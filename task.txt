A Python program, that provides z-x-y map tiles over http.
tiles should be transparent svg, in left top corner -- should be current weather in the position: temperature(C), 
 weather icon (cloudy, sunny, rain, snow, etc) and an arrow pointing the wind direction.
weather should be fetched from openweathermap. coordinates should be rounded to the 2nd digit after the dot and results should be cached to reduce number of api calls
Program should be packaged as docker, propagating port 8112 to access the http server
